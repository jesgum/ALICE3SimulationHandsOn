## Scope of the session
- Learn what the other utility tasks do for the on the fly simulation do (TOF, RICH, ClusterSize), integration with hyperloop 15 min
- Use case 1: use of the TOF PID in an analysis with multiple detector configurations for primary tracks for e.g. dileptons 30 min
- Use case 2: reconstruct of the invariant mass of the D meson 30 min

## At the end:
- At the end the analyser should be able to run a full analysis and extract a physics perforamnce statement on the detector configuration used as input
